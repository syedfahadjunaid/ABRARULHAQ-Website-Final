                <strong>Busducts </strong> in any electrical construction, are used for transporting electrical power to
                a shorter distance
                but many utilization point, within the building or a compound of facilities. Though cables can also be
                used in these areas, their economic impact would be high if compared to the effective Busduct. It will
                help us to tap power directly from where we want it to be and make utilize to the service point.

                Busduct, a prefabricated trunk consisting of Copper / Aluminium busbars and suitable insulating medium.
                The size of the trunking system will be bigger for air insulated system compared to Sandwich type
                insulated Trunking system. A sample MEP specification of Busduct is given here for the reference.

                <strong> FIRE PROTECTION FOR BUSDUCT</strong> <br>

                1.&nbsp; A declaration of fire resistance for 240 minutes minimum to ISO 834, BS 476, DIN 4102 Part 2
                shall be
                provided by the Busduct manufacturers. <br>
                2.&nbsp; Fire rated materials shall be fitted by the contractor to fill openings where Busduct passes
                through
                floors or walls with floor/wall flanges supplied by the Busduct manufacturer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>TAP-OFF POSITIONS AND TAP-OFF UNITS OF BUSDUCT</strong> <br> 

                1.&nbspBusduct shall have tap-off positions where shown on the drawings. <br>
                2.&nbspEach tap off position shall be provided with automatic safety shutters to shield the live busbars
                where
                the position is not occupied with a tap off unit. <br>
                3.&nbspTap-off positions shall be non-flared and suitable for tap-off units to be plugged on to the
                busbars. <br>
                4.&nbspShutters shall be activated by the insertion of the tap-off units and will only operate if the
                boxes are the correct way round. <br>
                5.&nbspThe plug in contact shall self align with the busbars and plug-in openings shall provide personal
                protection and safety of IP 2X when in the open position and IP54 in the closed position in accordance
                with BS EN 60529. <br>
                6.&nbspWithin risers, plug-in tap-off positions shall be provided with a maximum distance of one plug-in
                opening for each 1000mm. <br>
                7.&nbspTap-off boxes shall be constructed of zinc plated sheet steel and shall be complete with hinged
                lids
                with an ASTA certified protective standard of IP54. <br>
                8.&nbspThe tap-off boxes shall have circuit protective devices as applicable and shown on the drawings
                with
                mechanical interlocks to prevent tap box removal unless the mechanism is in the off position. <br>
                9.&nbspWhere tap-off boxes are inserted into live Busduct, they shall be designed and constructed so
                that the
                current carrying metal parts are not exposed during the insertion and removal of the boxes. <br>
                10.&nbspThe tap-off box shall remain earthed during removal, until all live connections are disabled.
                The
                tap-off box shall ensure that the box can only be inserted to give correct polarity. <br>
                11.&nbspAll operational handles shall be pad lockable. <br>
                12.&nbspTap-off boxes up to 630A shall be of the plug-on type for ease of installation and removal. <br>
                13.&nbspThe tap-off units shall be MCCB current limiting type. The MCCBs shall compliment those used
                elsewhere
                (for the distribution panels) in order to allow co-ordination and future addition of shunt trip/motor
                operation devices.

              <p>
                <strong>CAST RESIN BUSBAR</strong> <br>

                1.&nbspCast resin bus bar shall be utilised to achieve the fire rating requirement where noted on the
                drawings
                and called for in the specification (see concerned section). <br>
                2.&nbspGenerally the cast resin bus bars shall be as outlined above. <br>
                3.&nbspManufacturer: Recommended in the list of Manufacturer or equal and approved.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>EXECUTION OF ELECTRICAL BUSDUCT INSTALLATION</strong> <br>
                1.&nbspInstallation manuals detailing handling, storage, installation, energisation, maintenance and
                joint
                assembly must be provided by the manufacturer. The contractor shall ensure that the Busduct is stored on
                site in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation manual, in a clean and dry environment. <br>
                2.&nbsp; Provide low reactance bus duct system as specified and shown. <br>
                3.&nbspInstall system as specified and shown and as recommended by Bus Duct Manufacturer. <br>
                4.&nbsp;Use a torque wrench to ensure uniform tension on bus duct joints. After completion of
                installation, and
                before system is turned over to Owners, re-check each bolted joint with a torque wrench in an approved
                manner. Torque adjustment shall be as recommended by Bus Duct Manufacturer. <br>
                5.&nbsp; Cover ventilated bus with a weatherproof heavy duty plastic envelope as soon as it has been
                installed.
                Do not remove this cover until the building is clean and dry and bus ready to megger and energise.
                6.&nbspMegger each bus duct in an approved manner before it is energised. <br>
                7.&nbspBus duct layout throughout has been based on dimensions of a generic bus duct. The Contractor
                shall
                include for ensuring that the bus duct selected can be installed in locations indicated without any
                increase in contract price and without any increase to room size or encroachment of other areas. <br>
                8.&nbspEnsure that adequate special provision and/or allowance is made for pouring resin compound when
                making
                joints on cast resin busbar. <br>
                9.&nbspEnsure the rising busbars, cable tray, distribution board, tap off arrangement and other services
                are
                coordinated in the riser spaces prior to installation. <br>
                10.&nbspProvide protective sleeves around bus ducts as they pass through walls and floors prior to
                making good.
              </p>
